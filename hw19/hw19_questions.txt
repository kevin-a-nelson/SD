1. It was easier to reverse the stack because I could create a temp array. 

        int temp[pos];
        for(int i = 0; i < pos; i++){
            temp[i] = numbers[pos-i-1];
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < pos; i++){
            numbers[i] = temp[i];
        }
        
    I can't make a temp array with nodes very easily
